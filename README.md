# User Story 
- AS A manager
- I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
- SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles


# Usage 

- This application will allow user to generate a team profile
- Users will be prompt to enter a manager information
- Then user will have choices to select to add a team member (an engineer or an intern) or end the application
- When user selects Engineer, user will be prompted to enter Engineer information included the GitHub
- When user selects Intern, user will be prompted to enter Intern information included the school
- When user selects to end application, HTML page will be generated
- Once HTML page have been created, all the profile entered will be displayed
- When user click on an email address in the HTML, default email program opens and populated the TO field of the email with the address
- When user click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
